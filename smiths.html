    <div class="words"><p>Review by Dudley Storey</p></div>
    <div class="words"><p>While perhaps best remembered as the movie in which Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt became
        star-crossed lovers, <i>Mr. & Mrs. Smith</i> deserves more attention than your typical A-list action movie.
        In particular, the film’s trenchant critique of suburbia, marriage, and the lies we tell each other every
        day make it a relevant, contemporary movie.</p></div>
<div class="words"><p>As the film is now almost 10 years old, I will be revealing some mild spoilers in this review,
    but it should not be enough to disturb enjoyment of the movie.</p></div>
<div class="words"><h2>A Slow Death In Suburbia</h2></div>
<div class="words"><p>The very first scene of the movie with John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) Smith features them in the
    modern suburban torture chamber: therapy in the office of a marriage counsellor. While denying that they need any
    kind of help (“Just a maintenance checkup” John claims) it is obvious that they are deeply uncomfortable in each
    other’s presence, a rawness helped by the fact that this was the first scene shot in the film.</p></div>
<div class="words"><p>As told in flashback, the couple originally met under dramatic and emotionally heightened
    circumstances in Panama, framing both their attraction and the cause of their self-destruction. Each is an assassin
    for a rival company, but instinctively uses their cover as a civilian contractor from the moment they meet,
    successfully fooling each other for the first six years of their relationship. It is this same deceit that
    threatens the end of their marriage.</p></div>
    <div class="words"><p>In this way the film is very similar to <i>True Lies</i>, the action-comedy film directed 10
        years earlier by James Cameron. However, in that film the deceit was almost entirely one-sided, the
        manipulation significantly more disturbing, and (being a Cameron-Schwarzenegger film) focused much more on
        spectacle.</p></div>
    <div class="words"><p>While seeing each other as equals, it quickly becomes apparent that John and Jane are very
        different people. Jane is reserved, precise, analytical, poised; her husband is rough-and-tumble, raw and
        improvisational. Every remaining bit of their energy is devoted to maintaining a successful cover: a fine
        house, the latest model cars. But it is only in danger and risk that they come alive: life in suburbia is
        boredom and ennui, and it’s clear that they can’t wait to escape the prison they have built for themselves
        each day.</p></div>
    <div class="words"><h2>Marching Orders</h2></div>
    <div class="words"><p>When their respective employers discover who they work for, John and Jane are set to kill
        each other. While these first attempts fail, the seething resentment of both wife and husband fuels a series
        of mounting revenge attacks. Their destruction comes almost gleeful – you can see them actually <i>enjoying</i>
        themselves when they are hunting each other, in stark contrast to the the passive-aggressive competition of
        their marriage – and ultimately frees them from the web of lies they have spun.</p></div>
    <div id="fight"><img src="../images/gunfight-in-the-department-store.jpg"></div>
    <div class="words"><p>Having failed in eliminating their rival, the previously inimical companies contracting John
        and Jane temporarily put aside their differences to end the problem of the Smiths, driving them closer together
        in survival instinct. The last third of the movie is the fight of John and Jane against the joined forces of
        their companies, culminating in a final showdown reminiscent of the climax in <i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
            Kid</i>.</p></div>
    <div class="words"><h2>Conclusion</h2></div>
    <div class="words"><p>While it is not without its faults (in particular Vincent Vaughn’s misogynistic, eternally
        frustrated character has become all too familiar in too many movies), the film also has a significant share of
        charm. The chemistry between Pitt and Jolie is natural and unfeigned, and the film mixes great action sequences
        with a barded critique of modern suburban life, and it remains, on the whole, one of my favourite films.</p></div>
    <div class="words"><p>Rating: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★</p></div>
    <div class="words"><p>Sadly, the rest of the film was not shot chronologically: I was feel that doing so imparts
        an extra emotional verisimilitude to an actor’s performance, as they can express the emotional arc of their
        character in the same sequence that the audience experiences it.</p></div>
